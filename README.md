# Metabolic Age Calculator PWA

A conversational Progressive Web App for calculating metabolic age through an interactive chat interface.

## Features

- ðŸ¤– Conversational chat interface
- ðŸ“± Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline support
- ðŸ§® Deterministic metabolic age calculation
- ðŸ“Š Detailed results with factor breakdown
- ðŸŽ¨ Modern, responsive UI design
- âš¡ Fast and lightweight

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## How It Works

The app uses a conversational flow to collect user data:

1. **Basic Info**: Age, height, weight
2. **Gut Health**: Bowel regularity, bloating, energy, sensitivities, fermented foods, vegetables, hydration, meal timing
3. **Lifestyle**: Sleep quality, activity level, stress level

The metabolic age is calculated using deterministic formulas based on:
- BMI (Indian cutoffs)
- Gut Score (0-100 scale)
- Sleep quality
- Activity level
- Stress level

## PWA Features

- Service worker for offline functionality
- App manifest for installability
- Responsive design for all devices
- Fast loading and smooth animations
